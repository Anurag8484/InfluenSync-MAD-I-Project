Project Details
Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform

Problem Statement:

It's a platform to connect Sponsors and Influencers so that sponsors can get their    
       product/service advertised and influencers can get monetary benefit.

How I approached problem:

As a newbie to the programming world I took help from instructor sessionâ€™s  on how to approach and start building project.

So, I started by configuring the schema of my database , relationships, attributes, entities, keys.(ER Diagram Next Page)

After that, I moved on with the approach of doing backend + frontend simultaneously.
